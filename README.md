## Motivation

According to the NYS DMV, between 2011 and 2013 there were 212,267 motor vehicle accidents in New York City, resulting in 833 deaths. In 2014, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the Vision Zero Action Plan, with the aim of eliminating all traffic fatalities in New York City by 2025.
When the city debated the causes of these accidents and the most effective means to combat them, they turned to a dataset compiled by the DOT, which analyzed all NYC traffic crashes from 2008 to 2012.

For this project, I would like to examine this dataset from 2012 to 2013 along with traffic volume and vehicle classification data, and 311 complaints to identify areas around the city that are particularly hazardous for motor vehicles, and display common “symptoms” of these areas.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to identify locations around the five boroughs that are prone to motor vehicle accidents by factoring in data like the number of accidents, fatalities, injuries, and number of vehicles involved (adjusting for traffic volume), and profiling these hazardous areas.

Tasks derived from objectives:
* Develop classification algorithm for classification of areas.
* Analyze hazardous areas for “symptoms”
  *  Analyze 311 complaints related to street/traffic conditions
  *  Analyze type of traffic (commercial, passenger, taxi)
* Plot areas labeled as hazardous, along with profile for area (most common vehicle type, most common 311 traffic/street condition related complaint)
